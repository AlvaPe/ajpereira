Students will learn about how the scientific method of research\r\ncan be applied to the study of human behaviour, adopting both\r\nqualitative or quantitative methods of analysis. In the first part of\r\nthe course, students will learn about how to identify research questions\r\nand conduct literature reviews. In this same section, we will discuss\r\nquestions related to research ethics and how such concerns can affect\r\nthe kinds of questions one can ask and how other questions can be\r\nanswered empirically. Next, we will discuss questions related to\r\nargumentation. These include defining clear concepts of interest and\r\nproposing strong arguments for building theories that will subsequently\r\nbe evaluated with data. The following section covers how researchers go\r\nabout choosing among methods of analysis and how cases are selected to\r\nadequately evaluate their research questions. Finally, the course will\r\ncover a series of commonly used qualitative and quantitative methods of\r\nanalysis, including interviews, focus groups, surveys, and\r\nexperiments\r\nRequired course text\r\nBrancati, D. 2018.
